  after any parameters given.
* Changed -D to -d and -H to -h.
0.73 - 0.74
* Fixed bug in counting (introduced in 0.73)
* Optimised traversal. The command 'cfas -d 0 dir1 dir1/subdir' will output two entries, which both include subdir.

* Added --include PATTERN and --exclude PATTERN options for filtering
0.75 - 0.77
* Fixed issue with recursion on filesystems with very deep directory structures
