* Removed -d, --directory option. Instead, 'directories to walk' can be provided as an arglist
  after any parameters given.
* Changed -D to -d and -H to -h.

* Fixed bug in counting (introduced in 0.73)
* Optimised traversal. The command 'cfas -d 0 dir1 dir1/subdir' will output two entries, which both include subdir.
  Traversal of directories now ensures that every dir is only touched once.
